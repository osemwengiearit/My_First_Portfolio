    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>

    <p>
      This is the first paragraph. I am excited to begin my journey into web
      development and learn how to build cool things for the internet. This
      webpage is my first step toward becoming a skilled frontend developer.
    </p>

    <h2>A Section About Learning</h2>

    <p>
      In this section, I am exploring how to use different HTML tags to
      structure a webpage. I have already learned about headings and paragraphs,
      which are essential for organizing content and making it readable for
      visitors.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am also learning how to add images and make them clickable. This helps
      bring a page to life and allows me to link to other websites or resources.
      It's a fundamental skill that every developer needs.
    </p>

    <h3>A Glimpse into the Future</h3>

    <p>
      This is the fourth and final paragraph. As I continue my training, I will
      build more complex and interactive websites. I can't wait to start with
      CSS to add style and JavaScript to add functionality. The possibilities
      are endless!
