            <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>

            <p>This is the first paragraph. I am excited to begin my journey into web development and learn how to build cool things for the internet. This webpage is my first step toward becoming a skilled frontend developer.</p>

            <h2>A Section About Learning</h2>

            <p>In this section, I am exploring how to use different HTML tags to structure a webpage. I have already learned about headings and paragraphs, which are essential for organizing content and making it readable for visitors.</p>

            <p>I am also learning how to add images and make them clickable. This helps bring a page to life and allows me to link to other websites or resources. It's a fundamental skill that every developer needs.</p>

            <h3>A Glimpse into the Future</h3>

            <p>This is the fourth and final paragraph. As I continue my training, I will build more complex and interactive websites. I can't wait to start with CSS to add style and JavaScript to add functionality. The possibilities are endless!</p>
